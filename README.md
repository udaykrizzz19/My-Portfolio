## üé® About The Project

Welcome to my Digital Canvas‚Äîa modern, interactive, and animated personal portfolio designed not just to list my skills, but to showcase them in an immersive environment. This project blends sleek design with cutting-edge web technologies to create a memorable user experience.

The core philosophy was to build more than a static page; it was to create a space that reflects my passion for both design and development, featuring fluid animations, 3D elements, and a user-centric interface.

## üöÄ Key Features

-   **üé® Themed Experience:** A beautiful theme toggle between **Dark & Light Mode**. User preference is automatically saved in their browser for a consistent experience on return visits.
-   **üé¨ Fluid & Animated UI:** Powered by **Framer Motion**, the interface features seamless page transitions and subtle, delightful micro-interactions on all interactive elements.
-   **üîÆ Interactive 3D Worlds:** Engaging `FloatingGeometry` elements built with **Three.js** add a layer of depth and interactivity to each section, making the experience dynamic and unique.
-   **üì± Fully Responsive Design:** A mobile-first approach ensures the site looks and functions flawlessly across all devices, from small mobile screens to large desktop monitors.
-   **üì´ Seamless Communication:** A fully functional contact form integrated with **EmailJS** delivers messages directly to my inbox, providing a reliable line of communication.
-   **üìÑ One-Click CV Access:** A prominent "Download CV" button allows recruiters and visitors to easily access my professional resume.
